# the test_port can be basically any USB-Serial converter port
# to see the devices available run "pio device list" in the PlatformIO
# terminal.
# in case of blackmagic probe - choose the serial port that has a higher
# denomination in the last digit. The lower one runs the gdb server and the
# higher one is the serial pass through.
